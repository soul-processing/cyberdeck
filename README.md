# information on the devterm

## personal issues
- sometimes won't boot
- had some issues with the keyboard but fixed it like a boss
- battery cover falls out because it's 3d printed

forum: you can search issues you have here
- the discord works fine too, but i hate discord

there is a [3d model file](https://www.clockworkpi.com/product-page/devterm-3d-models-in-obj-format-free) for the pieces of the devterm. Currently there is no printer paper holder in the system, you can 3d print one, OR ask someone with a 3d printer to print one.
thermal paper: A 58mm Thermal Printer which supports 200 DPI high-speed monochrome printing.
- the type of paper that people are recommending is [here](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/t/devterm-a06-assembly-report/7267/10)

assembly guide: [for when you wanna look at its guts](https://github.com/clockworkpi/DevTerm/blob/main/Clockwork_DevTerm_Assembly_Guidelines.pdf)
- the image that is currently installed is the A06 version.
- you can change to whichever version you want by following the link [here](https://github.com/clockworkpi/DevTerm).
- I haven't done anything to the devterm except customize the UI to make it look like windows 95.
- to install a new version, extract the image from the tar file, then flash the firmware to the sd card using the instructrions in the page.
